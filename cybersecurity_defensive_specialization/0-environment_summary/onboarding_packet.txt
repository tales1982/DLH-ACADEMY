NOTE FROM SARAH PARK (IT DIRECTOR):
"This is what we have in the ticketing system. It's not complete. Some
things were added by the previous IT manager, some by Marcus, some by
my team. Anything marked [UNVERIFIED] hasn't been physically confirmed
in over a year."

=== QUICK NOTES -- DO NOT SHARE ===

Things I need to document properly but haven't had time:

NETWORK:
- Flat network at Central. Medical devices, workstations, servers all on
  the same broadcast domain (10.10.0.0/16). This is insane. I brought it
  up with Sarah. She said segmentation is "planned for next fiscal year."
  That was 4 months ago.
- Westside clinic has NO firewall. Traffic goes through a consumer router
  (Netgear Nighthawk -- yes, really) directly to an ISP connection. The
  site-to-site VPN to Central runs on this router.
- Guest WiFi at Central DOES exist (separate SSID) but I'm not convinced
  it's actually isolated. Need to verify.
- HQ VPN seems properly configured but I haven't audited the ACLs.

SERVERS:
- billing-srv-01 keeps having performance issues. IT just restarts it.
  Something is wrong. Sticky note on my monitor as reminder.
- print-srv-01 is running Server 2012 R2. End of support was Oct 2023.
  Nobody seems to care.
- backup-srv-01: Veeam runs nightly backups to a local NAS. The NAS is
  in the same server room, on the same network, same rack. If we get
  ransomware, we lose both. I mentioned offsite/cloud backup to James.
  Budget was denied.
- ehr-db-01: PostgreSQL is accessible from the entire 10.10.0.0/16 range.
  Should be restricted to ehr-srv-01 only.

AUTHENTICATION:
- Password policy: 8 chars minimum, 90-day rotation, complexity enabled.
  Not terrible but not great. No MFA anywhere except James's personal
  account (he set it up himself).
- Shared accounts: the radiology department uses a shared login for the
  PACS workstation ("raduser / radiology1"). I reported this. Nothing
  happened.
- SSH: password auth is still enabled on all Linux servers. Should be
  key-only. I started migrating but only got to ehr-srv-01 before...
  well, before I ran out of time.

PHYSICAL:
- Server room badge access is the same generic badge everyone gets. See
  my email to Sarah from [5 months ago]. Response: "on the roadmap."
- No cameras in server room corridor. There are cameras in the parking
  garage and the ER entrance but nowhere near IT infrastructure.
- Westside has basically zero physical security for IT equipment. The
  "server closet" doesn't lock.

COMPLIANCE:
- HIPAA Security Rule compliance has never been formally assessed. James
  is aware and concerned. Legal says "we're compliant" but has no evidence.
- No formal incident response plan exists. When the ransomware hit
  billing-srv-01 in January, the response was ad-hoc. James, Sarah and
  I basically improvised for 4 days.
- No business continuity plan. No disaster recovery plan. If Central
  loses power beyond what the UPS can handle (about 20 minutes), there
  is no documented procedure for clinical operations.

WHAT I HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO:
- Formal vulnerability assessment of all servers
- Endpoint security evaluation (antivirus is Sophos but I don't know
  if it's current on all machines)
- Cloud service inventory (O365 is the main one but I suspect individual
  departments use others)
- Threat landscape analysis -- who targets hospitals and how? Started
  researching but didn't finish.
- The IoT devices. God, the IoT devices. Those Philips monitors are on
  the same network as everything else. The infusion pumps too. If someone
  gets on the network they can reach the pumps. I try not to think about
  it.

DOCUMENT 6: ORG CHART (Relevant to Security)

    +-- CFO: Robert Kim
    |
    +-- COO: Angela Torres
    |     |
    |     +-- Clinical Directors (per department)
    |
    +-- General Counsel: David Park
    |

          |
          +-- James Chen, Deputy CISO
          |     |
          |     +-- Security Analyst: [YOU] (replacing Marcus Webb)
          |
          +-- Sarah Park, IT Director
                |
                +-- 3x System Administrators
                +-- 2x Network Technicians
                +-- 1x Database Administrator
                +-- 2x Helpdesk Analysts (incl. Mike Torres, lead)
                +-- 2x Desktop Support Technicians

  NOTE: James reports to the vacant CISO position. In practice he
  reports directly to CEO. Sarah Park (IT Director) and James Chen
  (Deputy CISO) are peers. James has authority over security policy
  but no authority over IT operations. This creates friction.
