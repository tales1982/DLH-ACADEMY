# 6. The Misconfiguration Findings

**Goal:** Analyze vulnerabilities that have no CVE identifier and understand why they are equally dangerous.

## Context

The scan report contains findings marked as "Misconfiguration" with no CVE. No CVE means no CVSS score, no NVD page, no Exploit-DB entry. It also means most automated prioritization tools will ignore them. That is exactly the problem.

The MongoDB Ransomware Wave of 2017 affected 28,000 databases. Not one had a CVE. Every single compromise was a misconfiguration: databases exposed to the internet with no authentication. The Capital One breach of 2019 that exposed 100 million records was a misconfiguration. Not a software bug. A misconfigured AWS WAF rule.

## Instructions

Identify 6 misconfiguration findings from the scan report (findings with "N/A" for CVE). For each one:

- **Finding ID:** [From scan report]
- **Host:** [Affected system]
- **Misconfiguration:** [What is wrong, specifically]
- **Why No CVE:** [Explain why this is a configuration error, not a software bug]
- **Severity Assessment:** [Critical/High/Medium/Low - your judgment, justified]
- **Cross-Reference 1x00:** [Does this correspond to an observation from your walk-through (1x00 T3), a control gap (1x00 T5), or a network scan finding (1x00 T7)? Be specific.]
- **Comparable CVE Risk:** [Name a CVE from the scan that has a similar real-world risk level, and explain why the misconfiguration is equally or more dangerous despite having no CVSS score]

After the 6 analyses, answer in one paragraph: Why does the statement "Our CVE scan shows nothing critical, we are secure" provide dangerous false assurance?
