# 0. The Advisory Analysis

**Goal:** Translate the CISA advisory into a MedDefense-specific impact assessment, proving you can apply threat intelligence to your own environment in real time.

## Context

The CISA advisory describes a generic attack chain. Your job is to make it specific. Every step in Crimson Tide's playbook must be mapped to a specific MedDefense system, vulnerability and gap. The question is not "could this happen to hospitals?" The question is "could this happen to MedDefense, with our specific infrastructure, and if so, how exactly?"

## Provided Files

- `cisaadvisorycrimson_tide.txt`

## Instructions

Read the entire advisory. Then produce a **MedDefense Impact Assessment** that maps every phase of the Crimson Tide attack chain to MedDefense's specific environment.

For each of the 7 phases in the advisory:

```
Phase [N]: [Name from advisory]
Advisory Description: [1-sentence summary of what the attacker does]

MedDefense Mapping:
  Target System: [Specific MedDefense hostname/system]
  Vulnerability Reference: [Finding ID from 1x02, or OSINT finding from 1x04, or new CVE]
  Gap Reference: [Gap ID from 1x00 or control gap from 1x03]
  Crypto Weakness: [From 1x04 if applicable]
  Current Protection: [What control, if any, currently blocks this phase?]
  Verdict: [EXPOSED / PARTIALLY PROTECTED / PROTECTED]
```

After all 7 phases, produce:

**Overall Exposure Score:** How many of the 7 phases is MedDefense currently EXPOSED to? (Express as X/7.)

**Critical Finding:** In one sentence, what is the single most urgent action MedDefense must take in the next 4 hours based on this analysis?
