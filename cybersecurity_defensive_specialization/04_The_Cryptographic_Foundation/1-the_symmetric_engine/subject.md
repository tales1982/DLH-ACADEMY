# 1. The Symmetric Engine

**Goal:** Master symmetric encryption through hands-on OpenSSL operations, comparing modes, measuring performance and building an automation script.

## Context

Symmetric encryption is the workhorse of modern cryptography. Every file encrypted at rest, every database field protected, every VPN tunnel carrying data between MedDefense sites uses symmetric encryption at its core. AES is the standard. But "use AES" is not a complete answer. AES-128 or AES-256? CBC or GCM mode? What are the performance implications?

You are going to find out by doing it.

## Instructions

### Part 1 — AES Encryption and Decryption

Create a test file containing the text: `Patient: Jane Doe | DOB: 1985-03-14 | MRN: MED-50421 | Diagnosis: Atrial Fibrillation`

Encrypt this file using OpenSSL with three different configurations and document the exact command for each:

- AES-256-CBC (the traditional mode)
- AES-256-GCM (the authenticated encryption mode)
- AES-128-CBC (reduced key length)

### Part 2 — The Performance Measurement

Create a 100MB test file: `dd if=/dev/urandom of=testfile bs=1M count=100`

Encrypt it with each of the three configurations above and measure the time taken for each.

### Part 3 — The Script

Write a script `1-symmetric_encrypt.sh` that takes three arguments: an input file, an output file and a mode (`cbc` or `gcm`). The script should encrypt the input file with AES-256 in the specified mode and output the result.
