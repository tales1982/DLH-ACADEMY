# 3. The Hash Laboratory

**Goal:** Explore hashing through experimentation: observe the avalanche effect, crack weak hashes, understand salting and key stretching, and build an integrity verification tool.

## Context

Hashing is not encryption. Encryption is reversible (with the key). Hashing is one-way. This distinction matters enormously because MedDefense stores password hashes in Active Directory, and the difference between a well-hashed password and a poorly hashed one is the difference between "attacker has hashes but cannot use them" and "attacker has every user's password in 30 minutes."

## Instructions

### Part 1 — The Avalanche Effect

Hash the string "MedDefense" with SHA-256:

```
echo -n "MedDefense" | sha256sum
```

Now hash "MedDefense1" (one character added). Compare the two hashes. How many characters of the hex output differ? This is the avalanche effect: a single bit of input change should change approximately 50% of the output. Repeat with MD5. Document all four hashes.

### Part 2 — Hash Collisions and the Birthday Problem

MD5 produces a 128-bit hash. SHA-256 produces a 256-bit hash. Calculate: how many possible unique outputs does each produce? (Express as a power of 2.)

Explain in 3-4 sentences why a shorter hash is more susceptible to collision attacks and what a birthday attack exploits. Reference Finding 018 from 1x02 (Kerberos weak encryption): if MedDefense's AD uses RC4 for Kerberos tickets, which relies on MD5 internally, what is the practical implication for password security?

### Part 3 — Rainbow Table Demonstration

Hash the password "password123" with MD5:

```
echo -n "password123" | md5sum
```

Go to crackstation.net and look up the resulting hash. Document what you find.

Now hash "password123" with a salt:

```
echo -n "s4lt9xQ2:password123" | md5sum
```

Look up this salted hash on crackstation.net. Document the result. Explain in 3-4 sentences why salting defeats rainbow tables and why every user needs a unique salt.

### Part 4 — Key Stretching

Research bcrypt, PBKDF2 and Argon2. For each, explain in 2-3 sentences: what it does differently from a simple hash, why it is more resistant to brute-force and what the "cost factor" or "iteration count" parameter controls.

Which would you recommend for MedDefense's application password storage, and why? Which is used by Active Directory by default (research this) and is it adequate?

### Part 5 — The Integrity Verification Script

Write a script `3-hash_verify.sh` that:

- Takes two arguments: a file path and an expected SHA-256 hash
- Computes the SHA-256 hash of the file
- Compares it to the expected hash
- Outputs "INTEGRITY OK" if they match, "INTEGRITY FAILED - expected [hash] got [hash]" if they do not
- Returns exit code 0 on success, 1 on failure
