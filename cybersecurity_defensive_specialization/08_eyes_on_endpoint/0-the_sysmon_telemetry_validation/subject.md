# 0. Sysmon Telemetry Validation

**Goal:** Validate that Sysmon is correctly capturing security-relevant events by triggering specific actions and verifying each one produces the expected Event ID.

## Context

You deployed Sysmon, with a SwiftOnSecurity baseline plus 5 custom rules. But deployment does not equal coverage. A configuration error, a missing event type or an overly aggressive exclusion can create silent blind spots. This task proves that every critical Sysmon event type is actually firing by running a controlled test sequence and checking the results.

## Instructions

Write a PowerShell script `0-sysmon_validation.ps1` that triggers specific actions and verifies Sysmon captures each one:

- Process creation (Event ID 1): Launch `cmd.exe /c whoami` and verify the event includes the full command line
- Network connection (Event ID 3): Initiate an outbound connection (e.g., `Test-NetConnection` to a known IP) and verify the destination IP, port and process are logged
- File creation (Event ID 11): Create a file in `C:\Windows\Temp\` and verify the event includes the target filename and creating process
- Registry modification (Event ID 13): Write a test registry value and verify the event includes the key path, value name and operation type
- DNS query (Event ID 22): Resolve a domain name and verify the query and result are logged

For each action: log the timestamp, search the Sysmon event log for the matching event, record whether it was captured with the correct Event ID and detail level.

## Expected Output

```

[*] Running Sysmon telemetry validation...
    [1/5] Process creation (Event ID 1)...
