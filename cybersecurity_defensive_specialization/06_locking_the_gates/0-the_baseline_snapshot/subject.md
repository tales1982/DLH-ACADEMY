# 0. The Baseline Snapshot

**Goal:** Capture the complete security state of a system before any changes, establishing the measurement that every subsequent task will improve against.

## Context

You cannot prove hardening worked if you do not know where you started. This task captures the system as it is: unhardened, default configuration, every setting at its out-of-the-box value. Every number you record here is the number you will improve.

## Instructions

Write a script `0-baseline_snapshot.sh` that captures the complete security baseline of a Linux system. The script must:

- Record system identification (hostname, OS, kernel version, uptime)
- List all running services and their state
- List all open ports and listening sockets
- List all SUID and SGID binaries
- List all world-writable files (excluding `/proc`, `/sys`, `/dev`)
- Capture current sysctl security-relevant parameters
- Capture current SSH configuration settings
- Record active user accounts and sudo group membership

## Expected Output

```
$ sudo ./0-baseline_snapshot.sh
Hostname: billing-srv-01
OS: Ubuntu 22.04.3 LTS
Running services: 24
Open ports: 11
SUID binaries: 23
SGID binaries: 12
World-writable files: 7
```
